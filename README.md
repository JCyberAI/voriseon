This  is homework #1 from my Full Stack Certification program
What i am tasked to do is play a developer role in a real world situation.
The real world situation in this HW assignment is for the developer to assist a company who submits a ticket for assistance on their website funcionality.
There are certian requirements that must be met in order for a passing grade on the assignment, such requirements were to ensure the linkage of all HTML & CSS elements. Some findings were that several CSS selectors were missing the syntax '.' in front, this is so the CSS selector is called from the HTML file. This resulted in the HTML elements on the users end to not function properly.
